# Podcast

This is a personal program I've developed over several years to handle my podcast routine/approach.
This program is responsible for managing the podcast files on my computer, and when requested to, copying
them over to my android device.

There isn't any overarching design or plan, the program has just adjusted over time based on my needs.

It is very unlikely that anyone would find this program applicable to them, but since I've often referred
to this repo on my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@SeniorCodeReviewBuddy) I figured that I should
open source it so people can take a look if they like.
